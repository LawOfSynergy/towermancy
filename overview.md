# Towermancy

## Premise
It is all fine and good to rely on magic that only affects your personal self or anything that you wish to target directly. But something is missing. When you think of mages, do you picture and individual with a small hut in a swamp and a couple of altars? Or do you picture a city of towers, steeped in magic and wisdom, where the very environment crackles with energy, and there are no limitations within its confines? This is just as possible as flinging around a ball of fire to attack your enemies or turning plants into magical energy.

## Items
- Diamond Infused Quartz (Main crafting material)
	- 8x Nether Quartz Block
	- 1x Diamond
- Tower Core (Key crafting component)
	- 1x Nether Star
	- 8x Diamond Infused Quartz
- Tower Heart (Multiblock Keystone)
	- 1x Tower Core
	- 8x Nether Start Block

## Structures
- Tower Heart - sphere with some sort of awesome visual effect
	- Tier based - (bigger sphere)
		- increased area of affect
		- increased core capacity
	- especially expensive item
- Tower cores
	- determine the effects provided by the tower heart over the entire region. 	These should be fairly expensive. Each one requires a Tower Core.
	- These are small spheres that hover around the tower heart itself.
		- AE Integration
			- quantum core (3-slot quantum link chamber per core)
				- when installed, also causes the tower heart to act as an ME 				Controller. Access is only possible through an attuned quantum 				link chamber. Cables CANNOT be physically attached to the tower 				heart.
			- data core (hi-capacity me drive (20 slots?))
			- wireless core (attune ae wireless receivers)
				- as long as they are within the demense of the tower heart or 				one of its pylons
		- Potion core
			- 3 slots
			- applies the effects of all stored potions (without consuming)
		- 
- Statues
	- Apply auras, like beacons or the tower heart. The exact effect depends on the statue
- Pylon multiblock structures
	- anchors the magic of the tower heart in a remote location
	- Pylon Core
		- 1x Nether Star
		- 4x Diamond Block
		- 4x Gold Block


## Special effects
Any effect applied by a tower core occurs within the entire area covered by the tower heart (and any associated pylons). An effect applied by a statue only affects things within the range of the statue, which must itself be within range of a tower heart (or active pylon). If a statue has an effect that opposes one already in place by the tower heart, then the statue takes precedence. The range of a statue can extend past the tower heart's borders if the statue is near the border

- Restorative: All zombie villagers are slowly converted back into normal villagers. (integrate with minecraft comes alive?)
- Fertility: everything grows fast, similar to the lilypad of fertility
- potion effects: individual and combo
- Tranquility: no enemy mob spawns
- Hostility: enemy mob spawns/increased spawns (statue only)
- Clement: no dehydration or hyper- or hypo- thermia
- Inclement: increased dehydration and extreme temperature (statue only)
- Stasis: blocks cannot be destroyed or updated. Fluids do not flow. Machines and furnaces do not operate. The environment is literally in stasis except for the statue itself. Only affects blocks. (statue only)
- Shielding: entities, players, and mobs cannot take damage
- Repairing: items automatically have their durability repaired

- Charged: RF powered items get charged. This is externally powered, so it requires attunement to a tesseract channel. (thermal expansion integration)

- Stabilizing: Reduces the likelihood of mishaps during infusion (thaumcraft integration)
- Purifying: applys the effects of silverbloom, pure nodes, and the flux scrubber (thaumcraft integration)


## Enchanced Portals
transparent view through to the linked dimension plus seamless transition

## Tower Creator UI
A UI that allows you to select a tower type (from list of schematics) and specify what the different blocks are for each category (main, floor, detail 1,2,3 etc.) And create a structure generator. When you place it and right click on it, it will generate the structure at that location with that structure and block configuration. May or may not require the full number of resources it would actually take to build the real thing.

This will probably be accessed from some sort of magic table/workbench.
